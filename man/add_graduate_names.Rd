\description{
This function takes as input a data frame which includes the raw
  text associated with each graduate. It returns that data frame along with
  two new columns: first.name and last.name. We assume that both the first
  name and the last name consist of a single string. That is, even if
  someone's true last name is Gonz√°lez del Riego, we record the last name as
  Riego. If \code{complete} is FALSE, it also returns full.name.
