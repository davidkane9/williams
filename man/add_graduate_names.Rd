\description{
This function takes as input a data frame which includes the raw
  text associated with each graduate. It returns that data frame along with
  four new columns: first.name, middle.name, last.name and full.name. We assume
  that the first/middle/last names consist of a single string. That is, even if
  someone's true last name is Gonz√°lez del Riego, we record the last name as
  Riego.
