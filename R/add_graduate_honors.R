  ## Grab both possible honors  --- which are always after the first comma, if
  ## there is one. Tricky case involves Womenâ€™s, Gender and Sexuality Studies,
  ## as a major, because it includes a comma. However, there are no WGES honor
  ## students who also get honors in another major. But should we really just
  ## assume that? For now, let's just hack:

  raw <- str_replace_all(x$raw.text, "Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies|Women's and Gender Studies", "WGES")

  raw <- stringr::str_split(raw, ",", simplify = TRUE)

  raw[raw == ""] <- NA

  ## Ought to be a way to handle the two honors without so much code repetition.

  honor.1 <- str_replace_all(raw[ ,2],  " with | in", "")
  honor.2 <- str_replace_all(raw[ ,3],  " with | in", "")

  x$honor   <- str_match(honor.1, "^.*honors")
  x$honor.2 <- str_match(honor.2, "^.*honors")

  x$major   <- str_replace(honor.1, "^.*honors", "")
  x$major.2 <- str_replace(honor.2, "^.*honors", "")

  x
}
