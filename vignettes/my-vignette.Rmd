## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the data available in the wiliamsmetrics package. We have data on the faculty and graduates of Williams College from 2000-2001 academic year through 2015-2016.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(williamsmetrics)
data(graduates)
x <- graduates
```

## Faculty

We have not completed the collection of faculty data.

## Graduates

There were `r dim(x)[1]` graduates of Williams from `r min(x$year)` through `r max(x$year)`. The number of graduates averages about `r round(mean(table(x$year)))` per year. The largest class was `r as.numeric(tail(sort(table(x$year)), n = 1))` in 
`r as.numeric(names(tail(sort(table(x$year)), n = 1)))`. The smallest was 
`r as.numeric(head(sort(table(x$year)), n = 1))` in
`r as.numeric(names(head(sort(table(x$year)), n = 1)))`.
