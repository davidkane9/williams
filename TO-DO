Purpose of this file is to keep track of items to work on.

1. Get rid of the messsages and warnings when running create_factulty() or create_graduates().
2. Add faculty for 2017-2018 year, including .txt file. Update faculty.rda (use use_data() from devtools).
3. Fix python script errors having to do with Madison from Sam Crane and 
     Scarlett Jang parsing. (Just in case we ever need to recreate them.)
4. There are lots of errors in graduates/faculty. Look for them (especially 
    missing values). We should have an explicit NA rather than just white space.
5. Start using HW development advice, in, for example, release numbering schemes.
6. Release to CRAN. (Make sure to not waste CRAN's time.)
7. Send e-mail message to CRAN Package Announcement once package is on CRAN.
